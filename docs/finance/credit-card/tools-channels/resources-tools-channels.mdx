I explore comparison websites, calculators, and credit card aggregators to analyze features, fees, and rewards across different cards. These platforms simplify the decision-making process. Additionally, I actively participate in credit card forums, where real-world experiences shared by users guide my choices. Finally, I stay informed through financial blogs, podcasts, and reputable websites, ensuring I make smart decisions tailored to my needs.
By documenting my findings, I create a knowledge repository for future use. ðŸŒŸ
