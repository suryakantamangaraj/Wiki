Foreclosure is a legal process in which a lender seizes a property, usually a home, from a borrower who has defaulted on their mortgage loan payments.
The lender initiates the foreclosure process after the borrower has failed to make payments for a specified period, which is typically several months.
During the foreclosure process, the lender will sell the property to recover the amount owed on the mortgage.
