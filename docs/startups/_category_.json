    "description": "Startups have always intrigued me, and during my third year of my Bachelor's, I took the plunge and co-founded one. For two years, I was deeply involved in the hustle, learning firsthand the challenges and rewards of building something from the ground up. My experience fueled a passion for understanding the intricacies of the startup ecosystem, from the essential terminologies to the valuable lessons from those that didn't make it. Now, I'm curating all this knowledge into a comprehensive startup wiki, gathering resources, insights, and learnings to help others navigate this complex but exciting world."
